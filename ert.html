  <p class="ert-text"> “Beneath the Surface: Mapping Environmental Scars with Electrical Resistivity Tomography” is a multimedia, immersive installation that explores how geophysicists monitor oil spills and address wildfire risk in the Colorado Front Range. The work combines woven grass, a ceramic windchime, and a projected video to interpret data collected by environmental geophysicists from Colorado College in the Manitou Experimental Forest. 
<br><br>
    The installation has three interconnected layers chosen to abstract the research process. The first layer, projected video, is the closest communication with the audience, explaining the project’s purpose, methodology, and impact. It introduces the viewers to the scientific principles behind electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), how the tool works, and what it can tell us. The second layer, woven grass, reinterprets the data through embroidery. Patterns and color reconstruct images produced by ERT, with areas of soil saturated by oil in red, emphasizing the severity of contamination and evoking the imagery of grasses already on fire. The third layer, a ceramic wind chime, adds the auditory element of a ring to ‘sound the alarm.’ A painted wind forecast on the chime’s main structure references the forest’s vulnerability to high winds to reinforce the threat of wildfire. 
<br><br>
    The intention behind this installation is to invite viewers to move through the space, casting their shadows across the hanging elements. This engagement encourages the viewer to take an active position, physically placing them in the conversation of data acquisition and wildfire management. By drawing the viewer in through their senses, the video places them in the role of a researcher, using it as a primary source to provide context. At the same time, the other layers allow for personal interpretation and reflection. The goal is to create a space where local members can feel connected to the forest 30 miles north of them, can learn about the scientific process, and can explore the relationship between research, environmental threats, and human impact.

    This installation was displayed in May 2024 at the Coburn Gallery for the exhibition “Unearthing the Invisible,” curated to showcase the intersection between Geophysics and 3D design.

On March 05, 2024, a group of environmental physicists visited the Manitou Experimental Forest to survey oil spills and classify wildfire risk <br><br>

This forest is 30 miles north of Colorado Springs<br><br>

Within the Colorado Front Range, the Experimental Forest is one of 21 other monitored areas around the United States that have a high risk of wildfire<br><br>

Additionally, high winds in the area pose a greater threat of kindling and spreading<br><br>

Although wind and dry climate are common factors of wildfire spread, a lesser-known cause is oil spills<br><br>

When a fire is triggered on the surface, oil in the soil acts as fuel<br><br>

Resulting in long, hot burns<br><br>

But we walk on the surface of the earth, so how can we see spills below without disrupting the land?<br><br>

Electrical resistivity tomography<br><br>

ERT<br><br>

ERT is a tool that sends an electrical current through the ground and maps how easily the current flows through 3D space<br><br>

ERT measures in ohm meters<br><br>

Meters measure space, and ohms measure the strength of resistance <br><br>

Resistance is the opposite of conductance<br><br>

So low-value ohmmeters correlate with conductive materials<br><br>

But oil is non-conductive, meaning it does not readily conduct electricity<br><br>

Its signal might blend into dry dirt<br><br>

However, Geobacter, a type of bacteria, eats up oil spills and converts the sludge into a metallic armor<br><br>

ERT monitors oil spills by measuring the Geobacter colony’s armor<br><br>

Collecting data over time will show how the colony changes <br><br>

As the colony strength grows, the electrical conductivity increases, and more oil is cleaned up<br><br>

The data collected by the geophysicists is from one point in time<br><br>

Their data found a heavy concentration of conductive material (dark pink)<br><br>

However, as we walk on the surface of the earth<br><br>

What else flows below?<br><br>

Water<br><br>

Drinking water is ionic, with its minerals causing electrical conductivity<br><br>

However, fresh snow melt is uncharged<br><br>

The geophysics are left with conflicting data<br><br>

Is the ground conductivity due to an active oil clean-up or drinking water?<br><br>

What would be your next experiment to clear this confusion?<br><br>

  <p class="ert-text"> “Beneath the Surface: Mapping Environmental Scars with Electrical Resistivity Tomography” is a multimedia, immersive installation that explores how geophysicists monitor oil spills and address wildfire risk in the Colorado Front Range. The work combines woven grass, a ceramic windchime, and a projected video to interpret data collected by environmental geophysicists from Colorado College in the Manitou Experimental Forest. 
<br><br>
    The installation has three interconnected layers chosen to abstract the research process. The first layer, projected video, is the closest communication with the audience, explaining the project’s purpose, methodology, and impact. It introduces the viewers to the scientific principles behind electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), how the tool works, and why it can tell us. The second layer, woven grass, reinterprets the data through embroidery. Patterns and color reconstruct images produced by ERT, with areas of soil saturated by oil in red, emphasizing the severity of contamination and evoking the imagery of grasses already on fire. The third layer, a ceramic wind chime, adds the auditory element of a ring to ‘sound the alarm.’ A painted wind forecast on the chime’s main structure references the forest’s vulnerability to high winds to reinforce the threat of wildfire.

    The intention behind this installation is to invite viewers to move through the space, casting their shadows across the hanging elements. This engagement encourages the viewer to take an active position, physically placing them in the conversation of data acquisition and wildfire management. By drawing the viewer in through their senses, the video places them in the role of a researcher, using it as a primary source to provide context. At the same time, the other layers allow for personal interpretation and reflection. The goal is to create a space where local members feel connected to the forest 30 miles north of them, can learn about the scientific process, and can explore the relationship between research, environmental threats, and human impact, ultimately inviting reflection on oil spills and wildfire risk.

    This installation was displayed in May 2024 at the Coburn Gallery for the exhibition “Unearthing the Invisible,” curated to showcase the intersection between Geophysics and 3D design.

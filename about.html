  <p class="about-description">
    Greetings. My name is Ale Tornelli. I am a senior at Colorado College, where I study materials physics and Spanish.
    With this, I blend computer science, chemistry, and biology to explore bio-inspired technology,
    optics, and unconventional materials.<br><br>
    
    I am inspired by science because it is a value that unites us globally. With my skills in Spanish and Latin American studies, I hope to reinforce global innovation and welcome diverse perspectives into my scientific thinking. <br><br>
    
    As a self-taught multimedia artist, I use metal sculpture, ceramic, film, writing, sound, and drawing
    to resynthesize what I have learned to share with others. <br><br>
    This webpage centers a collection of my projects.

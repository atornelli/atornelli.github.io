  <p class="about"> Greetings. My name is Ale Tornelli. I study materials physics, spanish and art.
      With this I blend computer science, chemistry, and biology to explore bio-inspired technology,
      optics, and unconventional materials. I use art, whether metal sculptures, ceramics,
      or writing, to resynthesize what I have learned to share with others.
      This webpage centers a collection of my projects. <br><br>
